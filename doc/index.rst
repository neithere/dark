DARK â€” Data Analysis and Reporting Kit
======================================

`Dark` is an acronym for "Data Analysis and Reporting Kit". It helps find
patterns in a set of irregular (mixed) data, sort various documents and pile
them in stacks by certain properties, define schemata for existing data, build
pivot tables and calculate various aggregates. Great for CSV, JSON, etc.

`Dark` works with a number of databases (mainly key/value or document-oriented)
and requires `Docu`_ for that.

Moreover, it has cookies.
