Discovery
=========

Analyzes a mixed dataset and suggests document structures.

Usage example::

    from docu import *
    from dark import *

    db = get_db(backend='docu.ext.tokyo_cabinet', path='foo.tct')
    for structure in suggest_structures(db):
        print structure
        doc_cls = document_factory(structure)
        print '  %d entries' % doc_cls.objects(db).count()

    Analyses all documents in given database and returns a list of unique
    structures found. The usefullness of the result depends on the database:

    generated, while a more or less regular database can be easily inspected by
    this function.
